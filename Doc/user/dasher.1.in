.SH NAME 
dasher \- graphical predictive text entry system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR dasher " [" OPTIONS "] [" filename "]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Dasher
is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by
natural continuous pointing gestures. Dasher is a competitive 
text-entry system wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used.
.SH OPTIONS
.B dasher 
takes the following options:
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-appstyle = \fISTYLE\fR
Application style.  \fISTYLE\fR can be any of 
.BR traditional ", " direct ", " compose ", or " fullscreen .
The default is whatever was specified on the previous invocation of
Dasher, or \fBtraditional\fR when Dasher is started for the first
time.
.TP
.BR \-? ", " \-\-help
Describe command line options.
.TP
.B \-\-help-options
Describe the options available with \fB\-\-options\FR.
.TP
.BR \-o ", " \-\-options " [" option = value [, option = value ...]]
Override stored options.
Options values are remembered for subsequent invocations of Dasher.
.SH USAGE
The main Dasher interface is a window with a blank background
containing a column of letters on the right hand side.
Click the mouse button to start.  
When the pointer is to the right of the crosshair the screen will zoom
towards the point underneath the mouse pointer. 
To select a letter, move the mouse pointer into it and watch how it
zooms underneath the crosshair.   
A new column of letters will appear.
Staying within the box for the selected letter, move the pointer over
one of these letters to select it as the next letter.
Moving the mouse pointer to the left of the crosshair, or outside of
the box for previously selected letters, allows you to change
previously selected letters.
.PP
.SH Application Styles
.TP
.B traditional
Dasher displays an \fIedit box\fR above the main window.
Text entered via Dasher will appear in the edit box allowing the text
to be edited directly.
.TP
.B direct
The edit box is not displayed.
Dasher runs without focus and the text goes into whatever window does have
focus.
This way you can use it more practically to run your desktop.
\".TP
\".B compose
\" Don't know.
.TP
.B fullscreen
dasher expands to the entire screen.

.SS Alphabet
Choose a different alphabet. Dasher will automatically retrain itself if the
alphabet specified training file is present.
.SS Colour
Choose a different colour scheme.
.SS Control
Alter various control options
.IP "One dimensional mode"
Map the Y position of the mouse to a 2 dimensional position on the Dasher

.SH CONVERTING TRAINING FILES TO UTF-8
Dasher requires that training files be in the UTF-8 format, whereas most text
files are likely to be in ISO-8859 format. This doesn't matter for plain text,
but accented characters are encoded differently. In order to convert them, use
the 
.BR iconv (1)
program. For instance, if your training file is in ISO-8859-1 format (Western
European), run
.B iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 trainingfile >newtrainingfile
.SH FILES
.TP
.B DOCDIR
Directory containing system-wide configuration files.
.TP
.B ~/.dasher
Directory containing user specific configuration files.
.PP
.B Dasher
will utilise files of the following form from both of these directories:
.TP
.RI alphabet. ALPHABET .xml
The files defining the alphabets available to Dasher.
.TP
.RI colour. SCHEME .xml
The files defining the colour schemes available to Dasher.
.TP
.RI training_ LANGUAGE* .txt
Files containing the training data used by Dasher. 
These are UTF-8 encoded text and should contain a representative
sample of the relevant language.
User specific training files can be used to augment system wide data.
.PP
Refer to the Dasher manual for more information regarding the format
and editing of these files.
