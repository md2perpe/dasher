Dasher can be started using mouse position alone if clicking is not possible - select 'Start on Mouse Position' and 'Circle Start' to allow starting and stopping by dwelling in the circle in the centre of the display. The 'Two Box' start mode starts Dasher by dwelling in the two boxes in sequence. In the latter case stopping must be done through control mode."
