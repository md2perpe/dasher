Dasher Documentation
--------------------

The docbook source file(s) in Gnome/C/ should be considered the
authoritative version of the Dasher manual, together with any
translations in the Gnome directory. Please do not store any other
derived versions in CVS [1].

All other formats can be generated automatically:

1. HTML - Use docbook2html

2. PS/PDF - Use docbook2tex and jadetex/pdfjadetex. Note that regular
latex will not work on the output of docbook2tex.

3. Windows Help - Use xsltproc with the stylesheets available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/ to generate HTML which can
then be compiled to a .chm file using the Microsoft HTML Help Workshop
utilities, available from:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp

I'll try to write some scripts to automate this at some point.

course.
